	Abstract = {Background: Although tuberculosis (TB) is usually curable with antibiotics, poor adherence to medication can lead to increased transmission, drug resistance, and death. Prior research has shown several factors to be associated with poor adherence, but this problem remains a substantial barrier to global TB control. We studied patients in a high-incidence district of Lima, Peru to identify factors associated with premature termination of treatment (treatment default). Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult smear-positive TB patients enrolled between January 2010 and December 2011 with no history of TB disease. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors associated with treatment default. Results: Of the 1233 patients studied, 127 (10%) defaulted from treatment. Patients who defaulted were more likely to have used illegal drugs (OR = 4.78, 95% CI: 3.05-7.49), have multidrug-resistant TB (OR = 3.04, },

	</sec><sec>
	<title>Methodology</title>
	<p>For this case-control study, in 90 randomly-selected programme units treatment records were abstracted from all 2006 defaulters from the RNTCP re-treatment regimen (cases), with one consecutively-selected non-defaulter per case. Patients who interrupted anti-tuberculosis treatment for &gt;2 months were classified as defaulters.</p>

	<title>Results</title>
	<p>1,141 defaulters and 1,189 non-defaulters were included. The median duration of treatment prior to default was 81 days (25%?75% interquartile range 44?117 days) and documented retrieval efforts after treatment interruption were inadequate. Defaulters were more likely to have been male (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2?1.7), have previously defaulted anti-tuberculosis treatment (aOR 1.3 95%CI 1.1?1.6], have previous treatment from non-RNTCP providers (AOR 1.3, 95%CI 1.0?1.6], or have public health facility-based treatment observation (aOR 1.3, 95%CI 1.1?1.6).</p>

	<title>Conclusions</title>
	<p>Amongst the large number of re-treatment patients in India, default occurs early and often. Improved pre-treatment counseling and community-based treatment provision may reduce default rates. Efforts to retrieve treatment interrupters prior to default require strengthening.</p>

Design: Case-control study comparing patients who defaulted from TB treatment and patients who completed it using quantitative methods and open-ended questions. Results were interpreted in light of health professionals’ perspectives from a parallel study. A predictive model and simple tool to identify patients at high risk of default were developed. Sputum from cases with pulmonary TB was collected for smear and drug susceptibility testing. Results: 91 cases and 186 controls enrolled. Independent risk factors for default included current smoking, retreatment, work interference with adherence, daily directly observed therapy, side effects, quick symptom resolution, and not knowing one’s treatment duration.

	abstract = "Abstract Recently, credit scoring has become a very important task as credit cards are now widely used by customers. A method that can accurately predict credit scoring is greatly needed and good prediction techniques can help to predict credit more accurately. One powerful classifier, the support vector machine (SVM), was successfully applied to a wide range of domains. In recent years, researchers have applied the SVM-based in the prediction of credit scoring, and the results have been shown it to be effective. In this study, two real world credit datasets in the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository were selected. \{SVM\} and a new classifier, clustering-launched classification (CLC), were employed to predict the accuracy of credit scoring. The advantages of using \{CLC\} are that it can classify data efficiently and only need one parameter needs to be decided. In substance, the results show that \{CLC\} is better than SVM. Therefore, \{CLC\} is an effective tool to predict credit scoring. "

It presents a technique for optimal linear \{SVM\} classifier selection based on particle swarm optimization technique, providing significant amount of focus on imbalanced learning issue. It is compared to other classifiers in terms of accuracy and identification of each class. Experimental classification performance results, obtained using real world financial dataset from \{SEC\} \{EDGAR\} database, lead to conclusion that proposed technique is capable to produce results, comparable to other classifiers, such as logistic regression and \{RBF\} network, and thus be can be an appealing option for future development of real credit risk evaluation models.

Two key reasons behind may be: (1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and (2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these conventional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide good generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on a few artificial and real benchmark function approximation and classification problems including very large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce good generalization performance in most cases and can learn thousands of times faster than conventional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.11For the preliminary idea of the \{ELM\} algorithm, refer to “Extreme Learning Machine: A New Learning Scheme of Feedforward Neural Networks”, Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN2004), Budapest, Hungary, 25–29 July, 2004.
