	Abstract = {Background: Although tuberculosis (TB) is usually curable with antibiotics, poor adherence to medication can lead to increased transmission, drug resistance, and death. Prior research has shown several factors to be associated with poor adherence, but this problem remains a substantial barrier to global TB control. We studied patients in a high-incidence district of Lima, Peru to identify factors associated with premature termination of treatment (treatment default). Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult smear-positive TB patients enrolled between January 2010 and December 2011 with no history of TB disease. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors associated with treatment default. Results: Of the 1233 patients studied, 127 (10%) defaulted from treatment. Patients who defaulted were more likely to have used illegal drugs (OR = 4.78, 95% CI: 3.05-7.49), have multidrug-resistant TB (OR = 3.04, },

	Abstract = {The article offers information on a study conducted by the authors on factors related to treatment default in tuberculosis patients in Nairobi, Kenya. The study included 945 defaulters and others who completed the treatment between 2006-2008. It states that they attributed default to ignorance, traveling away from treatment facility and feeling better. Other independent factors included alcohol abuse, low income, use of herbal medication and male gender.},

	<title>Setting</title>
	<p>Under India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), &gt;15% of previously-treated patients in the reported 2006 patient cohort defaulted from anti-tuberculosis treatment.</p>
	</sec><sec>
	<title>Objective</title>
	<p>To assess the timing, characteristics, and risk factors for default amongst re-treatment TB patients.</p>
	</sec><sec>
	<title>Methodology</title>
	<p>For this case-control study, in 90 randomly-selected programme units treatment records were abstracted from all 2006 defaulters from the RNTCP re-treatment regimen (cases), with one consecutively-selected non-defaulter per case. Patients who interrupted anti-tuberculosis treatment for &gt;2 months were classified as defaulters.</p>
	</sec><sec>
	<title>Results</title>
	<p>1,141 defaulters and 1,189 non-defaulters were included. The median duration of treatment prior to default was 81 days (25%?75% interquartile range 44?117 days) and documented retrieval efforts after treatment interruption were inadequate. Defaulters were more likely to have been male (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2?1.7), have previously defaulted anti-tuberculosis treatment (aOR 1.3 95%CI 1.1?1.6], have previous treatment from non-RNTCP providers (AOR 1.3, 95%CI 1.0?1.6], or have public health facility-based treatment observation (aOR 1.3, 95%CI 1.1?1.6).</p>
	</sec><sec>
	<title>Conclusions</title>
	<p>Amongst the large number of re-treatment patients in India, default occurs early and often. Improved pre-treatment counseling and community-based treatment provision may reduce default rates. Efforts to retrieve treatment interrupters prior to default require strengthening.</p>
